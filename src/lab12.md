# Practical 12: File I/O

A useful application of classes and exception handling in Java is File I/O.
In this practical activity, we will utilize classes specifically meant to carry out file I/O with text files.

## Tasks

### Task 1

Write a program that reads from Exercise1.txt and counts the number of characters, words, and lines in a file.
Words are separated by whitespace characters.

[Exercise1.txt](./props/Exercise1.txt)

### Task 2

Suppose that a text file (Exercise2.txt) contains an unspecified number of scores separated by blanks.
Write a program that prompts the user to enter the file, reads the scores from the file, and displays their total and average.

[Exercise2.txt](./props/Exercise2.txt)

### Task 3

Write a program that creates a file named **Exercise3.txt** if it does not already exist.
Write 100 randomly generated integers into this file using text I/O.
Integers are to be separated by spaces in the file.
Read the data back from the file and display the data in increasing order.

### Task 4

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a file name and displays the occurrences of each letter in the file.
Letters are case-insensitive.
Here is a sample run:

    Enter file name: Exercise1.txt
    The occurrence of A's is 22
    The occurrence of B's is 6
    The occurrence of C's is 4
    The occurrence of D's is 6
    The occurrence of E's is 28
    The occurrence of F's is 4
    The occurrence of G's is 1
    The occurrence of H's is 3
    The occurrence of I's is 5
    The occurrence of J's is 14
    The occurrence of K's is 2
    The occurrence of L's is 7
    The occurrence of M's is 6
    The occurrence of N's is 4
    The occurrence of O's is 7
    The occurrence of P's is 4
    The occurrence of Q's is 0
    The occurrence of R's is 15
    The occurrence of S's is 16
    The occurrence of T's is 5
    The occurrence of U's is 6
    The occurrence of V's is 6
    The occurrence of W's is 1
    The occurrence of X's is 0
    The occurrence of Y's is 7
    The occurrence of Z's is 0
