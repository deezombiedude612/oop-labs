# Practical Preparation

## Integrated Development Environment

Going forward, I will be using IntelliJ IDEA by Jetbrains as my IDE of choice during demos.
However, this is not the only choice available - some good alternatives include Eclipse, Netbeans, and Visual Studio Code.
Of course, you are not forbidden to use a different code editor you're already familiar with, as long as you are able to write Java programs with it.

## Installing Java JDK

## Setting Up IntelliJ IDEA

Upon installing IntelliJ IDEA in your machine, there are a few configurations you will need to carry out before starting to use

## Testing IntelliJ IDEA

Create different Java files to contain each of the following code snippets.
Ensure that the code runs properly.

### Demo1

```java
public class Demo1 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Welcome ");
		System.out.println("To ");
		System.out.println("OOP Class");
	}
}
```

### Demo2

```java
public class Demo2 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("3.5 * 4 / 2 - 2.5 is ");
		System.out.println(3.5 * 4 / 2 - 2.5);
	}
}
```
