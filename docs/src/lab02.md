# Practical 02: Selection Statements

We will now proceed with implementing selection statements in this practical.
Selection statements in Java include the if-else statement, and the switch statement.

## Tasks

### Task 1

Write a lottery program that randomly generates a two-digit number (10-99), prompts the user to enter another two-digit number (also 10-99), and determines what the user wins according to the following rules:

- If the user input exactly matches the randomly generated lottery number, the reward is $10,000.
- If the user input has both numbers used in the generated lottery number, the reward is $3,000.
- If any one of the digits in the user input matches one of the digits used in the generated lottery number, the reward is $1,000.
- Give no reward otherwise.

### Task 2

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a year and display the Chinese zodiac animal that corresponds with the given remainder after dividing by 12:

| Remainder | Chinese Zodiac Animal | Remainder | Chinese Zodiac Animal |
| :-------: | :-------------------: | :-------: | :-------------------: |
|     0     |        Monkey         |     6     |         Tiger         |
|     1     |        Rooster        |     7     |        Rabbit         |
|     2     |          Dog          |     8     |        Dragon         |
|     3     |          Pig          |     9     |         Snake         |
|     4     |          Rat          |    10     |         Horse         |
|     5     |          Ox           |    11     |         Sheep         |
