# Practical Preparation

## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

Going forward, I will be using IntelliJ IDEA by Jetbrains as my IDE of choice during demos.
However, this is not the only choice available - some good alternatives include Eclipse, Netbeans, and Visual Studio Code.
Of course, you are not forbidden to use a different code editor you're already familiar with, as long as you are able to write Java programs with it.

## Installing Java JDK

Before installing the IDE of your choice, you will need to install the Java Development Kit (JDK) first.

Here are some video tutorials on how to install the JDK in your machine.

## Setting Up IntelliJ IDEA

As mentioned earlier, the program I will be using is IntelliJ IDEA.
Here are some video tutorials on how to install IntelliJ IDEA in your machine.

Upon installing IntelliJ IDEA in your machine, there are a few configurations you will need to carry out before starting to use IntelliJ IDEA.
The following video tutorial will help you get to speed in setting up IntelliJ IDEA before starting to program.

## Testing IntelliJ IDEA

Create different Java files to contain each of the following code snippets.
Ensure that the code runs properly.

### Demo1

```java
public class Demo1 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Welcome ");
		System.out.println("To ");
		System.out.println("OOP Class");
	}
}
```

### Demo2

```java
public class Demo2 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("3.5 * 4 / 2 - 2.5 is ");
		System.out.println(3.5 * 4 / 2 - 2.5);
	}
}
```
